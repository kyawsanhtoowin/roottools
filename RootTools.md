# Introduction #

RootTools is a library that developers can include in their apps to simplify using root on Android devices. The library contains several methods for common tasks including:

  * [Checking for busybox](Usage#Checking_for_busybox.md)
  * [Checking for su](Usage#Checking_for_su.md)
  * [Checking the SD card for available space](Usage#Checking_the_SD_Card_for_available_space.md)
  * [Running root commands](Usage#Running_root_commands.md)

The library is under constant work and we are always looking for new ways to help both developers and users by providing standard ways of using root.

## History ##

The project was started by Stericson (of MetaMorph fame) after a conversation with ChainsDD (of Superuser fame) about not having a good simple way to use root. Stericson had the first draft of the library written in a few short hours and passed it to ChainsDD for review. Shortly after pushing the code to Subversion, Cyansmoker (of NotEnoughSpace fame) joined in, refactored the code  and added memory optimizations. It was decided from the start that this would be a community project, by the community and for the community.

## Future ##

The future of RootTools is still undecided and mostly up to you, the users. When it comes to functionality, we only have so many ideas, we only really know how we use root. What we need from you is input on what you'd like to see in RootTools, as well as feedback on how the current functionality is working out for you.
